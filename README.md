# NBA-Api

UPDATE 6/5/2021:

I am still trying to find a way to host this and have it function as intended.  It is currently hosted on Netlify (https://nba-roster-api-practice.netlify.app/) but runs into CORS
errors and won't execute my axios.get() methods properly.  I am experiencing the same errors on my http://localhost as well.  However, if you clone this project and run 'npm run build' it will function as intended.
